# Begginer-projects

This project is basically just a set of personal challenges I'm going to be doing.
It's going to be following this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/). I will also be updating this as I go along.


### Vanilla JavaScript Projects

"Challenge" | Description
------------ | -------------
[Color Flipper](https://github.com/pointspotdot/Begginer-projects/tree/main/1-color_flipper) | This is a very basic HTML, CSS and JS project. There's a button that just changes the background color of a div.
[Counter](https://github.com/pointspotdot/Begginer-projects/tree/main/2-counter) | In this one, there is just a counter that increases or decreases a variable and changes the CSS classes according to a button that the user presses. There's also one that resets the counter to zero.
[Review Caroussel](https://github.com/pointspotdot/Begginer-projects/tree/main/3-reviews) | Just a caroussel of user reviews. The data is fixed, but the user can go backwards and forwards while checking the reviews. You can also press the surprise button to go to a random review.
[Responsive Navbar](https://github.com/pointspotdot/Begginer-projects/tree/main/4-responsive_navbar) | A responsive navbar with a toggle for the links. Pretty fun and quick to do. Links don't work xD
