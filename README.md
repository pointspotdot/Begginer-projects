# Begginer-projects

This project is basically just a set of personal challenges I'm going to be doing.
It's going to be following this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/). I will also be updating this as I go along.

1. [Color Flipper](https://github.com/pointspotdot/Begginer-projects/tree/main/1-color_flipper)
2. 
This is a very basic HTML, CSS and JS project. There's a button that just changes the background color of a div.

2. [Counter](https://github.com/pointspotdot/Begginer-projects/tree/main/2-counter)

In this one, there is just a counter that increases or decreases a variable and changes the CSS classes according to a button that the user presses. There's also one that resets the counter to zero. 

3. [Review Caroussel](https://github.com/pointspotdot/Begginer-projects/tree/main/3-reviews)

Just a caroussel of user reviews. The data is fixed, but the user can go backwards and forwards while checking the reviews.
